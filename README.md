Deploying a High Availability Web App via CloudFormation
Creating this project will give you the hands-on experience you need to confidently talk about infrastructure as code. We have chosen a realistic scenario where you will deploy a dummy application (a sample JavaScript or HTML file) to the Apache Web Server running on an EC2 instance.

*There will be two parts to this project:*

Diagram: You'll first develop a diagram that you can present as part of your portfolio and as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script.

Script (Template and Parameters): The second part is to interpret the instructions and create a matching CloudFormation script.
