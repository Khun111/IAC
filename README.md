Deploying a High Availability Web App via CloudFormation
Creating this project will give you the hands-on experience you need to confidently talk about infrastructure as code. A realistic scenario has been chosen where you will deploy a dummy application (a sample JavaScript or HTML file) to the Apache Web Server running on an EC2 instance.

*There will be two parts to this project:*

Diagram: You'll first develop a diagram that you can present as part of your portfolio and as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script.

Script (Template and Parameters): The second part is to interpret the instructions and create a matching CloudFormation script.
## Scenario
Your company is creating an Instagram clone called Udagram.

Developers want to deploy a new application to the AWS infrastructure.

You have been tasked with provisioning the required infrastructure and deploying a dummy application, along with the necessary supporting software.

This needs to be automated so that the infrastructure can be discarded as soon as the testing team finishes their tests and gathers their results.

**Optional** - To add more challenge to the project, once the project is completed, you can try deploying sample website files located in a public S3 Bucket to the Apache Web Server running on an EC2 instance. Though, it is not the part of the project rubric.
